library management system in C++/MFC/Access

This is my project work of the course "Object-Oriented Programming-C++", which I took in my 1st year of undergraduate.

I wanted my work to be more novel than peer students, who were struggling to use plain c++ code and only show results in terminate console. Therefore the idea of designing a desktop version which can be used by ordinary people came out of my mind.
The project using c++ to impletement control flow and communication with database, Access, wihch was the first I know about databases when I was in that time.
MFC feature integrated in Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 helped me a lot to do UI design.
